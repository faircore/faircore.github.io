  <div class="post-content"><p>I think it is after seeing Idalin Bob√© <a href="https://mixitconf.org/2016/idalin-bobe-21st-century-activists-need-21st-century-skill-sets">TechActivism talk at MiXiT conference</a>, 3 years ago, that the various pieces of the puzzle needed for this project began to fall into place in my mind.
Today, I would like to announce the upcoming launch of a project called FairCore. It will be a community-driven platform intended to promote ethical services via a collaborative review process.
Certifications like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_certification">Organic</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_trade">Fairtrade</a> are more and more used for eating food that doesn&rsquo;t hurt you, so why not doing the same thing with FairCore applied to websites and applications.</p>

<p>My sources of inspiration for this upcoming platform are:
 - <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com">TripAdvisor</a> for the community-driven review process
 - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> for the reputation-based incentive and self-moderated contents
 - The <a href="https://openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> collaborative, free and open database
 - <a href="https://yuka.io/">Yuka</a> for the gaming-like experience and the ease of use (green, orange, red score with optional details)</p>

<p>The goal is to provide an easy way for users to choose their ethical services, but also to highlight companies and
organizations that respect you as a human, by protecting your data, avoiding leveraging cognitive biases to hijack your
mind, use open and predictable algorithms, and try to minimize their environmental impact.</p>

<p>FairCore goal is also to share existing initiatives like <a href="https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/">Privacy Exodus</a> and provide guidelines about how to design ethical services with privacy in mind from the beginning and respect our fundamental rights like:
 - Right to disconnection
 - Right to be forgotten
 - Right not to be the product when paying for a service
 - Righ to have control over our digital self</p>

<p>These guidelines will also provide guidance about the patterns (from a technical or UX/UI point of view) useful to build such services.</p>

<p>FairCore could be used as a place where users can be vocal about unfair behaviors of widely used services.
For example, one could think that Spotify is not fair when it forces you to share what you listen by resetting your private session after 6 hours of inactivity, even with a paid subscription.
Isn&rsquo;t it frustrating to have most of the cultural events only available via Facebook?
Or it could be nice to put the pressure on Apple and Google to make it possible to allow automatic &ldquo;plane mode&rdquo; to be disconnected when we want and to increase the battery-life of our smartphones (currently they prevent that even via applications).</p>

<p>Last but not least, to be successful, FairCore needs to be built by people coming from various background that has expertise on topics like design, software, psychology or philosophy, because building ethical services is a cross-cutting concern that is at the intersection of many domains.</p>
