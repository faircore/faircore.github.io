      <description>I think it is after seeing Idalin Bob√© TechActivism talk at MiXiT conference, 3 years ago, that the various pieces of the puzzle needed for this project began to fall into place in my mind. Today, I would like to announce the upcoming launch of a project called FairCore. It will be a community-driven platform intended to promote ethical services via a collaborative review process. Certifications like Organic or Fairtrade are more and more used for eating food that doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt you, so why not doing the same thing with FairCore applied to websites and applications.</description>
